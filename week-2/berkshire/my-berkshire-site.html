<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It's easy. I know HTML from previous experience. The typing is a little annoying though...

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was interesting.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I did it.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML is a markup language and therefore lacks functionalities that scripting language can provide. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Practice, practice, and practice.
