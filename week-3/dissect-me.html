			       Version control allows developers to keep track of development process, which makes it possible for a developer or a team of developers to trace an error back to its origin and better understand the nature of the problem. It also allows many developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. Most importantly, version controll ensures that the work from each developer is reviewed by someone else before it is integrated with the main code base. This precautionary action can reduce the chance of breaking the main code base and causing irreversable results.

			        Git helps to keep track of changes by providing a standardized work flow that ensures all changes are being tracked. Any changes made to a document first need to be staged. Then, when a major feature or stage of the development is completed, all the related changes will be staged and committed. When you do a commit, it takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores the snapshot permanently to Git directory. Then, the changes can be pushed to the main code base for a review. Once the review goes through, the code is merged with the main code base.

			        We use GitHub to store our code not only because we can host website on GitHub, but also because it allows developers from all over the world to collaborate on projects using Git.

		    	<p>The most advantageous reason to store your code on GitHub is that it can be easily shared. However, even if you are working on a project that only you are going to see, you can easily look at the different versions which you have labeled and marked.</p>
