The six phases of web design are information gathering, planning, design, development, testing and delivery, and maintenance.

My site's primary goal is to present myself to potential employers. My site will feature information about my past projects, employment, skills, social media connections, and personal information.

My target audience's interests include understanding my ability to perform certain tasks and possess certain skills. My site will address them by showcasing my past projects and programming skills.

The primary action that users take on include gathering information about me and reaching out to me.

The main things that someone should know about design and user experience include the fact that user experience is about the experience that an user has while visiting a website. This experience is partly based on usability of the website and can large determine whether user will complete actions intended by the site designers.

User experience design is about improving website users' browsing experience, which includes usability and visible experience. It is important because good user experience design tend to retain customers and prompt customers to return.

I found every part of the challenge interesting.
