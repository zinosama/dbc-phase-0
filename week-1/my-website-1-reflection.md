## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a new repo, go on github.com, log in, click the "+" on the top right corner, click "New repository", enter a name for the repo, change license to MIT, and click on the green button that says "create repository". To clone a repo, copy the "clone URL" on the right of your screen, go to your local git bash cmd, and type â€œgit clone {{paste the URL that you copied here}}", then enter. 

- Describe what open source means.
open source means the source code behind a program is open to public and thus developers can modify the code to create their own customized versions of the program.

- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
It makes me feel protective because knowing that a product is developed and examinated by thousands of other developers makes me feel confident that the product will be geared towards producing common good instead of merely being used a product to generate profit.  

- Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are useful tools to protect a developer's interest in his/her production. Open source protocols help developers to receive help from their communities and can significantly contribute to building more sophisticated software. However, without proper licensing, there is no guarantee that the original developer will receive proper attribution and credit for his/her hard work.
