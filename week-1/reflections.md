1.1 Think About Time Reflection
I've learned about the idea of flow, mindfulness, meditation, Timebox, and developing productive habits. Time boxing is about stopping and checking for progress during every certain period of time while pursuing in a goal. The idea is part of the Agile development process, which stresses on the ability to quickly respond to changing circumstance and demands while building a product. I can use this technique while writing an application - I will constantly seek feedback from friends and potential users in order to improve consistently. I manage my time currently by paying attention to develop and maintain good habits and prioritizing different daily tasks. My strategy is working great because it allows me to reduce non-essential work load and develop daily routines that improve efficiency and reduce the effort of daily planning. I want to try meditation because I've never done it before. I'm planning on doing moving meditation while doing typing practice. My plan for Phase 0 time management is to focus on the most difficult task at first, and then complete everything else as early as possible. 
1.2 The Command Line Reflection
A shell is an operating environment where programmers can interact with a computer by typing in various commands. Bash is one of the most popular shells. I've learned some of the commands from before, and therefore, it's not overwhelmingly challenging. The only issue I had was to set up my Windows operating system correctly so that I can access Bash. I used to have VMWare on my laptop where I could use Linux commands. But I've lost access to it after dropping out of school (the software was provided by my institution). I was able to use all of the commands on a different laptop. I think the most important commands are the basic ones such as ls, cd, mkdir, pwd, and mv.

pwd: prints current directory

ls: list directories and files

mv: moves a file or directory

cd: change directory

../: move to parent directory

touch: creates new file

mkdir: creates new directory

less: pages through a document

rmdir: removes a directory

rm: removes a file

help: displays information about commands

1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
To create a new repo, go on github.com, log in, click the "+" on the top right corner, click "New repository", enter a name for the repo, change license to MIT, and click on the green button that says "create repository". To fork a repo, go to any project page and click on the "fork" button on top right. To clone a repo, copy the "clone URL" on the right of your screen, go to your local git bash cmd, and type â€œgit clone {{paste the URL that you copied here}}", then enter. 

You would fork a repository in order to copy everything from an existing project onto a new branch, where you can do editing without affecting the original project.

I didn't have any struggle while setting up git and GitHub. I learned about how to fork and clone repo onto my local disk, which is kind of cool since I was a little afraid of git cmd before.
